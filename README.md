# Thematic priority areas ("Satsningsomr√•der")

Search strings used to find scientific works connected to strategic priority areas (2020-2022) and thematic priority areas (2023-??).

Covers (https://www.uib.no/en/priority-areas):
* Ocean - interpreted as ocean research ("Hav", **marine**)
* Climate and energy transitions ("Klima og energiomstilling", **KE**)
* Global challenges, with a focus on global health, migration and inequality ("Globale samfunnsutfordringer", **GSU**)

There are several files for each area:

* "TableauCristin" in the file names - These files contain the searches which are used to search in [Cristin data](https://www.cristin.no/), specifically data from DUCT. These searches are done in Tableau, and the searches are written to work in Tableau syntax (calculated fields). These files contain the main documentation of searches for scientific publications (delimitations of what is covered by each priority area, etc.).
* "WoS" in the file names - These files contain searches for Web of Science, and contain additional documentation relevant to adapation of the search to the Web of Science interface and search functionality.
* "Theses" in the file names - This file is for the *climate and energy transition* thematic area ("KE"), and documents a search string used to identify master and phd theses in data fetched from our institutional repository (KE_Tableau_theses.md).
