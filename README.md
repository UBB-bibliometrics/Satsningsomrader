# Thematic priority areas ("Satsningsomr√•der")

Search strings used in Tableau (DUCT FOR_data_sted_total) and Web of Science core collection to find scientific works connected to strategic priority areas (2020-2022) and thematic priority areas (2023-??).

The "Cristin" strings contain the main documentation of searches for scientific publications (delimitations of what is covered by each priority area, etc.), while the Web of Science strings contain additional documentation relevant to adapation of the search to the Web of Science interface and search functionality. 

For the climate and energy transition area ("KE") there is an additional file which documents a search string used to identify master and phd theses in a repository. 

Covers (https://www.uib.no/en/priority-areas):
* "Ocean" - interpreted as marine/ocean research ("Hav")
* Climate and energy transition ("Klima og energiomstilling")
* Global challenges, with a focus on global health, migration and inequality ("Globale samfunnsutfordringer")
