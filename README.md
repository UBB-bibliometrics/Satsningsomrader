# Thematic priority areas ("Satsningsomr√•der")

Search strings used in Tableau (DUCT FOR_data_sted_total) and Web of Science core collection for analysis of strategic priority areas (2020-2022) and thematic priority areas (2023-??).

The Cristin strings contain the main documentation (delimitations of what is covered by each priority area, etc.), while the Web of Science strings contain additional documentation relevant to adapation of the search to the Web of Science interface and search functionality. 

Covers (https://www.uib.no/en/priority-areas):
* "Ocean" - interpreted as marine/ocean research ("Hav")
* Climate and energy transition ("Klima og energiomstilling")
* Global challenges, with a focus on global health, migration and inequality ("Globale samfunnsutfordringer")
